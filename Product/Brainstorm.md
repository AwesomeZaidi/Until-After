# Until After
### Private journal that unlocks when you die.

What is it? Until After is a private journal that unlocks when you die.


### Why we're doing this? 
Journaling is healthy, it allows you to reflect on your day/week/life. Without reflection it's hard to make progression. When we die, we'd like to be remembered for something. It would be ground breaking if we could leave behind what we want to be remembered... to tell the truth of our lives.

### Painpoints we're tackling
- Wasted Media when you die. What happens to your notes after you die? What happens to all of your photos and messages? They're gone forever. 

### How?

Verification ideation methods:
- Someone you trust must request to access your account when you've passed away. Once that request is made, we ping you on text, call, email, and any socials you have set up as well to check if you're alive or not. 
Future Feature of this would be to also potentially scrape your social media accounts, access your email and phone to see if you've been active at all in the past 30-60 days - the user should be able to set how long they want the verification process to take. Minimum 30 days, maximium 1 year we say

- We require someone to upload an official document such as a screen shot of your obiturary or your death certificate for us to confirm on our end.

- Upon onboarding, you invite people to be required to confirm your death when you've died and for any of them to request to access your account once you've passed away. Once the request is made, everyone must confirm.


### How does the app work?
 - Users can begin to bullet journal in our app.
 - Every week creates a a dot representing that week and a color associated to how that week went.
 - When you create your account, you attach your twitter, facebook and google accounts. You attach your phone number and mailing address with proof of ID.
 - The next step is to prepare for when you die, do you want the world to be able to access your journal or specific people? If it's specific people, enter their email and name here and we'll send them the invitation.
 - Once you die, someone has to request to open your account. 
 - We can also post your will to your facebook wall for you and link your journal.
 - Once someone requests to open your journal, we send out a verification alert everywhere and wait 30 days for a response. You have 30 days to reply back with anything otherwise you are considered dead and your journal opens up. 
 - Additionaly, you can charge people to open your journal and have the revenue sent to a loved one if you wish, say, if you're a celeberty and want people to eat well even after your gone from your success and fame you could charge people $5 to open your journal.
 - We don't want you to store your life on our journal, as we don't want to carry all that burden for our security, instead, include account credentials to your dropbox, and any other storage apps you may be using.

 - Additionaly to bullet journaling, you can upload images and videos to suplement your journaling.

 - in Addition, you can choose if you'd like to do guided bullet journaling, journaling or self guided journaling, or guided self journaling...
 - We'd like to be able to check in with you for major life events and
