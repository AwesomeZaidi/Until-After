# Until After User Stories

These user stories are meant to help us find common ground with the development team.

In short, User Stories:

✔️ eliminate bridges between business and technical teams,
✔️ help with product understanding,
✔️ engage app users in process modelling.

So what is a user story? It's a description of an application’s functionality that's understandable to everyone involved in the product process from technical to non technical team members.

The User Story will consist of a Summary / Description.
(1. Who | 2. What | 3. Why / For What / From Where)
 

User creates account to journal.

User journals every week and a new dot is created in the UI. Once the user reaches one month, those 4 week dots are turned into one months dot.

User responds to a mood questionare that determines the hex color of their dots.

User's special friends can request access to their private journal once they've died,this requires an obituary or death certificate. Our team manually confirms their death, we also reach out to the person via text, email and social media to try getting a response back.

Users death verifications all check out, their journal is made public to whomever they've granted access.
